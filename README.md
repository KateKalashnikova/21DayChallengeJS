21 day coding challenge provided by Lighthouse Labs
### Day 1 Instructions
Our latest testing indicates a malfunctioning component in our communications apparatus. For some reason, messages from mission control are not being correctly displayed on board the shuttle. While the message is being displayed on the shuttle’s terminal, the sender’s name is not displayed beside it.

Your first task is to write a function that will take two string parameters and return a string containing the sender name and the message in the form specified in the instructions.
### Day 2 Instructions
Registering new astronauts was handled manually in previous missions but it's taking too much time. Knowing that the astronaut information is already listed in a data set, you propose to optimize that job with programming.

Your task is to automate that process by creating a function that will take in an astronaut object as a parameter and return a string using the properties of the astronaut.
