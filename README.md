# 21DayChallengeJS
21 day coding challenge provided by Lighthouse Labs
### Day 1 Instructions
Our latest testing indicates a malfunctioning component in our communications apparatus. For some reason, messages from mission control are not being correctly displayed on board the shuttle. While the message is being displayed on the shuttle’s terminal, the sender’s name is not displayed beside it.
Your first task is to write a function that will take two string parameters and return a string containing the sender name and the message in the form specified in the instructions.
### Day 2 Instructions
Registering new astronauts was handled manually in previous missions but it's taking too much time. Knowing that the astronaut information is already listed in a data set, you propose to optimize that job with programming.
Your task is to automate that process by creating a function that will take in an astronaut object as a parameter and return a string using the properties of the astronaut.
### Day 3 Instructions
Making sure that a value is within a specific range is a common task in programming. In this case, the structure given is a gauge object with a current value, a minimum and a maximum. If the current value is between the minimum and maximum, then everything is peachy, if not, we return a message saying that there is trouble.
Your task is to create a function that will take the gauge object as a parameter, and will return true if the current value is between the minimum and maximum, and return false if the value is outside those.
### Day 4 Instructions
Opposites hm? In our daily lives, an opposite can mean multiple things, but in programming, it's different. Opposites can only be used when dealing with logical expressions or booleans. Knowing that the property inside our toggle is called isOn, we can infer that the value attached to it is either true, or false.
Create a function that takes in a toggle object and will change the value of the property isOn between true and false and return the updated object. Using the function twice should revert the toggle back to its original value.
### Day 5 Instructions
Now that a crew has been selected, you need to write a new function that will assign a job to each astronaut. Since you’ve had some experience with updating object properties in some of the previous challenges, this should be fairly straightforward. Just keep in mind that you need to return the astronaut after updating the job property.
