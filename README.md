# 21DayChallengeJS
21 day coding challenge provided by Lighthouse Labs
### Day 1 Instructions
Our latest testing indicates a malfunctioning component in our communications apparatus. For some reason, messages from mission control are not being correctly displayed on board the shuttle. While the message is being displayed on the shuttle’s terminal, the sender’s name is not displayed beside it.
Your first task is to write a function that will take two string parameters and return a string containing the sender name and the message in the form specified in the instructions.
### Day 2 Instructions
Registering new astronauts was handled manually in previous missions but it's taking too much time. Knowing that the astronaut information is already listed in a data set, you propose to optimize that job with programming.
Your task is to automate that process by creating a function that will take in an astronaut object as a parameter and return a string using the properties of the astronaut.
### Day 3 Instructions
Making sure that a value is within a specific range is a common task in programming. In this case, the structure given is a gauge object with a current value, a minimum and a maximum. If the current value is between the minimum and maximum, then everything is peachy, if not, we return a message saying that there is trouble.
Your task is to create a function that will take the gauge object as a parameter, and will return true if the current value is between the minimum and maximum, and return false if the value is outside those.
### Day 4 Instructions
Opposites hm? In our daily lives, an opposite can mean multiple things, but in programming, it's different. Opposites can only be used when dealing with logical expressions or booleans. Knowing that the property inside our toggle is called isOn, we can infer that the value attached to it is either true, or false.
Create a function that takes in a toggle object and will change the value of the property isOn between true and false and return the updated object. Using the function twice should revert the toggle back to its original value.
### Day 5 Instructions
Now that a crew has been selected, you need to write a new function that will assign a job to each astronaut. Since you’ve had some experience with updating object properties in some of the previous challenges, this should be fairly straightforward. Just keep in mind that you need to return the astronaut after updating the job property.
### Day 6 Instructions
Create a function that takes in a roster array and an astronaut object. The function will add the astronaut to the roster and return the updated roster.
### Day 7 Instructions
Your task is to write a function that takes in the temperature, weather condition, wind speed, and direction as parameters and store them inside a structure that holds each value as properties.
There's a small and important detail for this one, you must convert the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius and convert the wind speed from miles/hour to meters/second, and round both of them before storing them.
### Day 8 Instructions
Your task is to create a function that takes in a roster array, and will calculate the amount of astronauts in the given roster list and return said amount.
Sometimes things are just simple, code doesn't need to be complicated!
### Day 9 Instructions
Your task is to create a function that will take in an array representing the roster of astronauts, and return an array containing the jobs of each astronaut as a string.
In other terms, for each astronaut of the roster, you want to take the job and add it to a list, then return said list.
### Day 10 Instructions
Your task is to create a function that will take in an array of weather objects and will return a rounded average of the wind speed.
Since we work with an unknown amount of entries, you will need to calculate the average wind speed using loops.
### Day 11 Instructions
Your task is to write a function that will take in a list of platforms and a date as a string. That function will update the date property on the first platform with an empty date and then return the platform list.
In other terms, for each platform of the platform list array, update the date of the first free one and then return the updated platform list.
